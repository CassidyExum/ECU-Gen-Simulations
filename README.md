# ECU-Gen-Simulations
Shoft Description: Exploratory Data Analysis of local solar data, and a simulation of ECU power consumption vs Generator runtime.

For this project I was tasked with delivering information to a contractor that will help my company develop an Environmental Control Unit (hereforth known as ECU), that would optimize our solar kit by reducing generator runtime.

Background: My company provides Solar Power kits to the United States Air Force. Our company works with the Rapid Sustainment Office (RSO) to research and develop ways for the Air Force to be lightweight and mobile. A major focus of the lightweight and mobile effort is to eliminate fuel as much as possible, due to the volume and weight it takes up in transit. Instead of fuel, we provide lightweight fabric with solar panels embedded, that can be installed in minutes onto tents and fabric ground mounts. We also provide a solar inverter, batteries, ECU, and emergency generator to suppliment energy production. My goal was to run a simulation using solar data downloaded from [PVWatts](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/pvwatts.php) to determine how the power consumption of the ECU drives generator runtime, supply our contractor with this data, work with my fellow engineers to determine internal generator and ecu improvements, and lastly to work with marketing on fuel savings with our kit vs standard military ECU and Generator.
